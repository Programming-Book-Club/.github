# Welcome to the Programming Book Club!
Here, we read book and build random stuff. Every once in a while, we'll find a new book focusing on a guided project and pick a date for everyone to start working on it independently.
# Why the book club?
We believe that everyone working on the same project independently, each with their own experience and assumptions, publically for eachother to see, is a great way for everyone to learn and develope skills together. We encourage discussion and asking questions, while being respectful of eachother skill levels in various fields.
